				<p>I love swimming because it is considered to be a healthy form of excercise, a great way to get fit and can be enjoyed by all the family. I spend 4 hours of my weekend practising different strokes. I have learnt so far freestyle and breaststroke. I look forward to mastering backstroke and butterfly.</p>

					When I'm not swimming or writting code, you'll find me challenging my friends FIFA. Its always a heated but joyfull moment getting to find out who is reigning in the showdowns. Other games I indulge are Drake's Fortune, Monopoly and City Skylines.

					<strong>
						My Personality as I perceive it:
					</strong>
					<br/>
						Self-confident analyst, people can rely on. My lightning-fast sensitivity helps me recognize what constitutes real value-quality and long-lasting. I gradually surround myself with real pearls that have been released from the fields of view of those who are not so perceptive and attentive. I value and enjoy my culture as a Kenyan. My style, exclusive and elegant, free from consumer fashion.

				<strong>
					Part of my personality hidden from me, but others can see:
				</strong>
				<br/>
					A pragmatic professional, confident in his abilities. I keep my life in control and do not rely on luck - only my actions. I solve problems in simple ways, avoiding unnecessary difficulties. I look at life and  everyday worries realistically, and take them resolutely. Im trusted by those close and lay responsibility on me knowing I can be relied upon. i never feel satisfied until i have completed what I begun.
